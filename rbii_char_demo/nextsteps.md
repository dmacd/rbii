  
x have claude refactor all classes to ClassName so I can actually read this
- can abbreviate DSL



- validate this is actually doing what i want a
  - can I give claude a pdf for reference to understand the intent? 
  - start eliminating the dumb trivial shortcuts
    - like in character memory lookup
- write out the actually program trees 
- log shit to aim
